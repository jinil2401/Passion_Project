# Startup News Management System

The **Startup News Management System** is designed to manage and organize news articles, categories, and user comments for a startup-focused news platform. The project is built using ASP.NET MVC for the frontend, ASP.NET Web API for backend services, and Entity Framework for ORM.

It provides comprehensive Web API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on articles, categories, and comments. The system is built with ASP.NET MVC and supports user-specific and category-specific content management.
